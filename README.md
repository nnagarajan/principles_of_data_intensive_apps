Database Systems: The Complete Book (2nd Edition), by Garcia-Molina, Ullman and Widom, covers a lot of the technical material in the course and may be helpful as a study guide. We focus on chapters 13-20. We will also cover the material in lectures, but this book is a good source of additional information.
